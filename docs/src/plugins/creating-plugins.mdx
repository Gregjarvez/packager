# Creating Plugins

Packager supports adding custom plugins in a form of [hooks](#hooks) that get fired in a sequential order.

## Simplest plugin

Creating a plugin is super simple. Let's take a look at the simplest plugin that you can write.

```js
const tinyPlugin = {
    name: "tiny-plugin",
    extensions: [".ts", ".tsx"]
};
```

That's it, seriously. It does absolutely nothing for us so let's build something more complex and usable.
But first, you may be wondering why we need `name` and `extensions` properties? Well, there are only 2 required properties when creating a plugin and they are (you guessed it) `name` and `extensions`. Trying to register a plugin without one of them, will throw an error.

There are of course other properties (or hooks) that you may add to your plugin to give it some super powers.

## Properties

#### name

This property is used primarily for displaying more descriptive error messages and internally, to keep track of transpilers and a few other things that you'll learn below ðŸ‘‡

<ApiProps type="string" required="true" />

```js usage=true
const amazingPlugin = {
    name: "amazing-plugin"
    // ...
};
```

#### extensions

Extensions property is required because Packager uses it to determine which types of files it should call the hooks on. Without it, it would call the hooks on every single file that passes through it and 99% of time, this is not what we want.

<ApiProps type="string[]" required="true" />

```js usage=true
const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    extensions: [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
    // ...
};
```

<Note>Note that extensions have dots in them.</Note>

#### transpiler

Transpiler is a Class object which is responsible for transpiling code and is arguably the most important part in a plugin. At its core, every transpiler has a [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API) to offload the transpilation process from the UI thread.  
Head over to [Creating a Transpiler]('/plugins/creating-a-transpiler') to see how to create one.

<ApiProps type="Transpiler" required="false" />

```js usage=true
import MyTranspiler from "./MyTranspiler";

const amazingPlugin = {
    // ...
    transpiler: MyTranspiler
    // ...
};
```

## Hooks

There are 3 hooks that your plugin can use - `resolver`, `loader` and `beforeRender`.

#### resolver

#### loader

#### beforeRender

## Registering your plugin
