# Creating Plugins

Packager supports adding custom plugins in a form of [hooks](#hooks) that get fired in a sequential order.

## Simplest plugin

Creating a plugin is super simple. Let's take a look at the simplest plugin that you can write.

```js
const tinyPlugin = {
    name: "tiny-plugin",
    extensions: [".ts", ".tsx"]
};
```

That's it, seriously. It does absolutely nothing for us so let's build something more complex and usable.
But first, you may be wondering why we need `name` and `extensions` properties? Well, there are only 2 required properties when creating a plugin and they are (you guessed it) `name` and `extensions`. Trying to register a plugin without one of them, will throw an error.

There are of course other properties (or hooks) that you may add to your plugin to give it some super powers.

## Properties

#### name

This property is used primarily for displaying more descriptive error messages and internally, to keep track of transpilers and a few other things ;)

<ApiProps type="string" />

```js usage=true
const tinyPlugin = {
    name: "tiny-plugin"
    // ...
};
```

#### extensions

#### transpiler

## Hooks

There are 3 hooks that your plugin can use - `resolver`, `loader` and `beforeRender`.

#### resolver

#### loader

#### beforeRender
